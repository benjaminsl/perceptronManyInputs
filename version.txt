18:

*keep weights the same instead of changing with every new dataset
 
19: 
* calculate error and have function checkOutput() return the rror
* show the user the error if it is anything besides 0

20:
* started update weight function

21:
* completed update weight function
* put update weight function in main.c
* changed perceptron.c to main.c and updated makefile

22:
* added documentation to main.c
* fixed function call of updateWeights in main
  	(arguments were in wrong order)

23:
* renamed update.c to functions.c and update.h to function.h
  	and updated all files to work with this change
* made getInput only have one argument because I'm no
    longer getting input form the user
* moved all function prototypes to functions.h
* moved all function definitons to functions.c

24:
* made it so program loops through data sets until all
		data sets are classified correctly
* tells user final weights
* added linke to tutorial on perceptron in main.c

percpetron 2 -----------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------
1:
	* changed input and weight variables to arrays

4:
  * modified another loop to take input/weights vectors instead of scalars

5:
	* made sure program was working right with weight 1 = .9 and weight 2 = .8
	* changed more lines to take vectors instead of scalars

6:
	* all changes from scalar variables to vector variables should be made now

7:
	* missed a few changes in 6. Did them in 7

8:
	* made a training data set with 3 inputs 
  * tried out 3 inputs (it worked!)
